Sudomemo Theme Customization Kit (WIP)

<h3>Theme Overview</h3>
<p>This section details the theme images, and where they appear on the Creator's Room page</p>

        <li>
          <h4>background</h4>
          <p>This image is displayed on the top screen. <br>
          It must contain the "Creator's Room" text.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>head</h4>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>foot</h4>
          <p>Head and foot are used as the top and bottom borders of the profile box.<br>
            <b>We recommend that you only change their color to match your theme,  as the profile box itself can only be styled with solid color.</b>
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>send</h4>
          <p>This is the "Posted Flipnotes" button. <br>
          It must contain the "Posted Flipnotes" text, but the icon is optional.

  <p>This image isn't part of the theme itself, but it is used as a thumbnail / preview image on the Sudomemo Theme Shop
  page. Please make sure that this image represents the overall look and feel of your theme. (:

<h3>Guidelines / rules</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <b>Don't use too many colors or gradients</b>
    <p>
      Themes are limited to a palette of only 256 colors (i.e. they use a bitmap image format). Because of this, please try not to use too much shading or too many colors in your theme images.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>No signatures or watermarks</b>
    <p>
      -- That is, should your theme be intended for the Theme Shop. Don't worry, there will be a link to your Sudomemo
      Creator's Room on your theme's page in the shop.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Keep it simple</b>
    <p>
      We would prefer simple, clean designs that fit in with the aesthetic of the Flipnote Studio app.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Follow the rules</b>
    <p>
      Of course, make sure that your theme follows the content rules as given in the <a href="http://www.sudomemo.net/help/?terms">Sudomemo Terms of Use</a>.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>FAQ</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <h4>If my theme is on the Theme Shop, will I recieve a commission when others buy it?</h4>
    <p>
      Yes! When someone buys your theme, you will receive 1/5 of the price that they pay in color stars (Sudomemo's currency-of-sorts).
      For example, if your theme is selling for 10 color stars, you will recieve 2 color stars commission for each sale!<br>
      You can use these stars to add to Flipnotes that you enjoy, or you can use them to purchase more themes for yourself.

    <h4>Do I need Sudomemo Citizenship to make a theme?</h4>
    <p>
      Sudomemo Citizenship isn't required. (:

  <li>
    <h4>Why can't I include copyrighted content or characters from a certain franchise?</h4>
    <p>
      We will not allow themes that contain copyrighted content. <br>
      Any themes containing copyrighted content would be classified as merchandise, as a result, we are unable to
      'sell' them without express permission from the copyright holder.

    subject line. <br>
